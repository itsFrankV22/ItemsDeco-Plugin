## Description

The **Item Suffix Plugin** is an extension for **TShock** that displays a decoration in the chat and as floating messages above the player, showing what they are holding in their hand. It can be configured in the config file.

## Features

- **Show item name**: Whenever a player changes the item they are holding, the name of that item will appear as a floating message above their head and in the chat. It also shows damage, and this can be toggled in the config.
- **Color customization**: The floating messages will be displayed in a predefined color (currently set to white, i.e., 255,255,255).
- **External configuration support**: The plugin now allows loading the configuration from an external JSON file called `ItemDecoConfig.json` inside the `tshock/ItemDeco/` folder to customize the colors and display.

## Installation

1. **Download the plugin**: Get the plugin's DLL file.
2. **Place in the plugins folder**: Copy the DLL file into the `plugins` folder of your TShock installation.
3. **Restart the server**: Restart the server to load the plugin.

## Usage

- Generally, I make PlugAndPlay codes, so you can use it without touching anything.
- Once installed and activated, no additional commands are required. The plugin will start working automatically, displaying the item name when you switch objects.
- The configuration file `ItemDecoConfig.json` is located in the `tshock/ItemDeco/` folder and allows customizing the floating message colors and other parameters. If the file does not exist, it will be generated with a default configuration.

## Permissions

No specific permissions are required to use this plugin. All players will be able to see the item name they are holding.

## Requirements

- **TShock**: This plugin requires a TShock installation for Terraria.
- **TShock Version**: This plugin is designed to work with the TShock API v2.1.
